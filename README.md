**Python TV Shows Torrenter**

**_Work in Progress_**

This script will scan a media library folder containing TvShows and parse the series and the seasons/episodes.

At the moment it will parse a folder, parse the filenames and generate a list of TvShows and the last episode

_Future Development_
- Add a torrenter class that will take the list and download the torrents for the next episode and place them in an output folder
- Add a menu to interact with the script
